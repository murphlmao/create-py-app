# Continuous Integration (CI)

This folder contains configurations for automating the build, test, and packaging process. The CI pipeline ensures that new code changes are integrated into the main codebase smoothly by verifying code quality through automated tests and generating build artifacts. These artifacts are packaged and stored for use in further stages of the pipeline.
